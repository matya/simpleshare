NAME 
    simpleshare - simple application for data sharing

DESCRIPTION
    Upload and share files via randomly generated url.

    From time to time I need to share some data with my friends, 
    having a place with lets'say basic authentication works fine
    but than you should also share the credentials.
    having randomly generated part in url solves the problem for this case:
     - you do not need to share any passwords
     - the data is secure, as it is hard to guess the random part

    Surely such a simple task doesn't need much coding and can be implemented purely in perl and cgi for example.
    But using framework as Dancer with it's plugins has many advantages: 
     - Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible - provides flexible authentication backedns (files,databases,ldap..)
     - Dancer::Session::Cookie - Encrypted cookie-based session backend for Dancer, 
     - Template::Toolkit - Template Processing System,
     - The application is much more extendable and readable, 
     - Coding with Dancer is just pure fun!

    The code does the following:
     Uploads files in upload directory. If you need to share files, creates symlinks in public/pub/$random/$file which you can share.
     the interface let's you manage shares and uploads - you can delete or unshare stuff.
     This is sufficient for my needs, but there is still room for improvements :)
    

INSTALL
    on a Debian Jessie:

    apt-get install  libdancer-plugin-auth-extensible-perl libdancer-session-cookie-perl libsort-naturally-perl libstring-random-perl libtemplate-perl

    on other systems: install perl modules mentioned above.

CONFIGURATION
    Create directories: upload and public/pub -  mkdir {upload,public/pub}
    Set the proper basedir path in config.yamli.
    The default should work if the application is launched from the root directory
    
    setup Auth::Extensible, by default config provider is used, but one can use whatever DPAE supports
    default credentials: user test pass beer, user test2 pass beer. Roles are not used so far.

USAGE 
    cd to the root of application and start it: ./bin/app.pl, open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
    alternatively install Plack:
        apt-get install libplack-perl
    and run it using plackup:
        plackup bin/app.pl, navigate to http://localhost:5000
