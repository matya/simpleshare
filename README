NAME 
    simpleshare - simple application for data sharing

DESCRIPTION
    Upload and share files via randomly generated url.

    From time to time I need to share some private data.
    Instead of sharing username and password for a web share it is easier to
    upload files to a share containing a random part.
    In this case:
     - you do not need to share any passwords
     - the data is secure, as it is hard to guess the random part

    Surely such a simple task doesn't need much coding and can be implemented 
    purely in perl and cgi for example.
    However using Dancer with its plugins has many advantages: 
     - Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible - provides flexible authentication 
       backends (files,databases,ldap..),
     - Dancer::Session::Cookie - Encrypted cookie-based sessions,
     - Template::Toolkit - Template Processing System,
     - The application is much more extendable and readable, 
     - Coding with Dancer is fun!

    The application is simple:
    Upload your files to the "upload" dir in the root of app.
    The files cannot be accessed in this dir without authentication. 
    Share file or set of files via randomly generated share - in this case
    a share is generated in public/pub/$randomshare containing symlinks to 
    selected files in upload/$user/$files. 
    public/pub/ is publicly accessible location. 
    You also can delete files and unshare shares, empty shares are deleted 
    automatically. Symlinks to deleted files are removed as well.
    This is sufficient for my needs, but there is still a room for improvements :)
    One also can setup a cronjob which will delete shares older than $maxage:
        
     find $approot/public/pub -maxdepth 1 -type d -mtime +$maxage -print
    
    s/-print/-delete/ if you really want to delete!

INSTALL
    on Debian Jessie:
    
    install at least the following modules:

    libdancer-plugin-auth-extensible-perl libdancer-session-cookie-perl 
    libsort-naturally-perl libstring-random-perl libtemplate-perl

    on other systems: install perl modules mentioned above.

CONFIGURATION
    Create directories: upload and public/pub:

    cd $approot/
    mkdir {upload,public/pub}

    Set the proper basedir path in config.yaml.
    The default should work if the application is launched from the root directory
    
    setup Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible, by default config provider is used, 
    but one can use whatever DPAE supports.
    The default credentials: user test, pass beer, user test2, pass beer.
    Roles are not used so far.

USAGE 
    cd to the root of the application and start it: 
    
    ./bin/app.pl 

    open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

    alternatively install Plack:

        apt-get install libplack-perl

    and start the app using plackup:

        plackup bin/app.pl

    navigate to http://localhost:5000
