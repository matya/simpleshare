NAME 
    simpleshare - simple application for data sharing

DESCRIPTION
    Upload and share files via randomly generated url.

    Surely such a simple task doesn't need much coding and can be implemented 
    purely in perl and cgi for example.
    However using Dancer with its plugins has many advantages: 
     - Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible - provides flexible authentication backends (files,databases,ldap..),
     - Dancer::Session::Cookie - Encrypted cookie-based sessions,
     - Template::Toolkit - Template Processing System,
     - The application is much more extendable and readable, 
     - Coding with Dancer is fun!

    The code does the following:
     Uploads files in the upload directory. If you need to share files, creates symlinks in 
     $approot/public/pub/$random/$file which you can share.
     The interface lets you manage shares and uploads - you can delete or unshare stuff.
     There is still a room for improvements :)
    
INSTALL
    on Debian Jessie:
    
    install at least the following modules:

    libdancer-plugin-auth-extensible-perl libdancer-session-cookie-perl 
    libsort-naturally-perl libstring-random-perl libtemplate-perl

    on other systems: install perl modules mentioned above.

CONFIGURATION
    Create directories: upload and public/pub:

    cd $approot/
    mkdir {upload,public/pub}

    Set the proper basedir path in config.yaml.
    The default should work if the application is launched from the application root directory.
    
    Setup Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible, The default is the config provider, 
    but one can use whatever DPAE supports.
    The default credentials: user test, pass beer, user test2, pass beer.
    
USAGE 
    cd to the root of the application and start it: 
    
    ./bin/app.pl 

    open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

    alternatively install Plack:

        apt-get install libplack-perl

    and start the app using plackup:
